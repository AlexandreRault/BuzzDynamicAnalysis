# BuzzProject

This project was developped in the context of a school assignment.
It focuses on instrumenting buzz code to print dynamically called functions.

Examples of input and output files can be found in the directory development/test/data. \
prog_#.bzz is the orignal code. \
prog_#.parse.tab is the parse tree. \
prog_#.pp.parse.tab is the formatted parse tree (more readable). \
prog_#.unparse.bzz is the code that has been pretty printed from the generated parse tree. \
prog_#.ast_injected.txt is the parse tree after the injection. \
prog_#.code_injected.bzz is the final result (the generated code from the injected parse tree).
